Version 1.0.5
	Fixes :
	* Fixed garbage collection on large files. Files over 500GB were not being claimed correctly because of the use of 32 bit integers.
	* Fixed for newest version of Java 7. Please update your java to the latest version to use this file.
	Enhancements :
	* SDFS now logs to files located in /var/log/sdfs/<config-name>.log. Logs roll after 10MB and one archive log is kept.
	* Added new Garbage Collection Framework.
		1. Threshold GC - Garbage Collection runs when DSE grows by a 10% step. This GC trades off better performance for higher
		realtime storage utilization. To enable this GC edit the local-chunkstore tag within the volume config and modify/add the 
		attribute gc-name="org.opendedup.sdfs.filestore.gc.PFullGC".
	* Added mkfs.sdfs commandline parameter gc-class. This can be used to set the garbage collection strategy at volume creation. 
	  The current option for this is  org.opendedup.sdfs.filestore.gc.PFullGC.
	* Added output to sdfscli --dse-info parameter called "DSE Percent Full". This calculates the percentage full for the dse.
	* Changed mkfs.sdfs commandline attribute --chunk-store-size to take MB/GB/TB
		e.g. --chunk-store-size=100GB
	* Optimize file option no longer takes a length.
	* Faster throughput through better threading
	

Version 1.0.1
	Fixes :
	* Snapshots were not functioning correctly
	* Volume creation to did not correctly report volume sizes
	* Memory utilization with lots of unclaimed hashes in the DSE
	* Garbage collection on sparse files was broken.
	Enhancements:
	* Near IO line speed performance at 4k block sizes
	* better threading and locking contention
	* Faster tiger hashing
	* Lowered memory requirements by 1/3 for new volumes and new DSE. Memory requirements for DSE Was 33 bytes for each
	unique hash and is 23 now.

Version 1.0.0
	Fixes :
	* Fixed : Volume Capacity configuration did not get set appropriately when TB was set as unit for capacity.
	Enhancements :
	* Windows : Added SDFS system variable.
	* Performance : Changed memory allocation for write buffers and threads per volume. This should increase performance by about 10% 
	for newer volumes
	* Performance : NFS performance should be on par between safeclose="true" and safeclose="false"
	* Performance : Some slight memory enhancements.
Version 0.9.7
	Fixes
	* SDFSCli : fixed command line for dedup-all. It was not parsing correctly
	* SDFSCli : fixed dedup rate % calculation to accurately represent actual dedup rates.
	* SDFSCli : fixed snapshot command to correctly reflect snapshot destination.
	Enhancements :
	* IO : Changed IO for file reads and writes. Should reduce memory requirements without reduced performance.
	* SDFSCli : Added command to clear old data manually from the SDFS Volume
	* Garbage Collection : Garbage collection plays nicely and does not take up a lot of IO when performed.
	* Volume : Added "maximum-percentage-full" option to sdfs configuration xml file. This will allow volumes to
	define the maximum size of a volume for writes. to set it to 100% of the volume capacity set maximum-percentage-full="100". The
	attribute itself goes into the <volume> tag. e.g. <volume maximum-percentage-full="200" [other options].... />. It it set to a "-1"
	it will be ignored.
Version 0.9.6 9/20/2010
	This versions focuses on fixes to Windows port of SDFS and memory utilization. 
	
	Fixes
	* Windows : Error when deleting files has been fixed
	* Linux : Fixed reporting "du -h". Now gives actual deduplication rates.
	* Both : Routing Config File was not being read when starting in network mode.
		
	Enhancements
	* Files can now be an unlimited size. Files used to be limited to approximately 250GB in size. This has been expanded to the size
	allotted by the underlying file system.
	* Better memory utilization. Changes to file maps should allow for better memory utilization for larger files.
Version 0.9.5 9/12/2010
	This version focuses on porting SDFS to Windows. SDFS can now be mounted on Windows (tested with Windows 7). Dokan and Java 7(32 bit) 
	are required for Windows Support. Windows support is experimental and not well tested. All features should work the same own Windows
	as they do on Linux except for permissions and symlinks. SDFS on Windows currently has no permissions.
	
	Enhancements :
	* Windows (32bit) Support. 
	* New Command Line Interface for getting file statistics and creating snapshots. Command line help is available using sdfscli --help. 
Version 0.9.4 8/27/2010
	This version focuses on enabling cloud based storage deduplication. The storage backend for the dedup storage engine has been rewritten to
	allow for cloud storage. Amazon S3 is the first storage provider that has been added but others will be added as requested. Basically all 
	data will be stored to the cloud storage provider and meta-data will sit on the local filesystem where the SDFS volume was mounted from.
	Enhancements :
	* Amazon S3 Storage enabled. This will allow users to store unique chunks to an S3 backend. 
	* AES 256 bit Encryption of data to cloud dedup storage engine. 
	* Compression for S3 cloud storage. 
	* Improved read performance through caching requests.
Version 0.9.3 8/15/2010
	Fixes
	* Fixed Verbose Logging. All logging is now outputted to log4j.
	* Fixed Nonempry dirs deleted by rmdir
	* Fixed extended attributes and dedupAll bit not being read from file meta-data
Version 0.9.2 5/2/2010
	Fixes	
	* Major Bug Fixed that removed data after time through garbage collection. All users should update to this release immediately.
	* Minor issue with copying attributes.
Version 0.9.1 4/24/2010
	Bug fixes and performance enhancements identified during testing on LVM volumes and NFS.
	Fixes :
	* Getting extended attributes that do not exist not exits as expected. This fix was needed for mounting of NFS mounted volumes
	Enhancements :
	* Caching of permissions improves performance for NFS writes.
Version 0.9.0 4/18/2010
	First Release of the 0.9.x tree. 0.9 will focus primarily of Volume Replication and bug fixes. SDFS has introduced a new 
	data scheme for file system meta data. This new scheme is not compatible with older volumes. If you would like to migrate
	to the newer volume structure you will need to copy data directly to a new SDFS volume. The DSE data structure is the same.
	Future versions will all be backwards compatible.
	Fixes :
	* Data Storage Issue within DSE: The DSE would only store 75% of the allocation size. This has been fixed and the DSE will now
	be able to be fully allocated.
	* Infinite Loop with Gabage Collection: There is an error within the Trove4J library used by the DSE that cause an infinite loop.
	A work around is in place that should help avoid the issue.
	* Possible infinite loop with DSE: There was an outlier condition found that cause the data storeage routine to hit an infinite loop.
	* Volumes not cleanly unmounted: A volume in not unmounted always when the application is killed.
	* ACLs for Directories and Symlinks: The mode was not being set correctly for directories and symlinks inheriting the permissions
	from the linked file
	Enhancements:
	* The data structure for file meta data has been changed to support volume replication and better performance for storing small 
	files. This change breaks compatibility with previous versions for SDFS. This is a one time change. Future versions will all be 
	backwards compatible.
	* Data Storage Performance has been increased by approximately 15% due to various DSE enhancements.
	* Better performance for file level snapshots.
	* Enables volume replication through rsync of volume namespace. DSE replication will be coming in later 0.9.x versions.
Version 0.8.15 4/12/2010
	This release focuses on enhancements and bug fixes found during scalability testing. 
	
	Fixes :
	* Symlink permission issues. Permissions were inherited from linked file. They are now independent. This is 
	consistent with native fs behaviors.
	* Fixed artificial limit found for hash tables. It is now possible to create volumes larger than 1TB at 4k chunk size.
	* Memory allocation fix. 1.6 GB memory was reclaimed. It is now possible to run small volumes of SDFS in under 100mb of RAM.
	Enhancements :
	* Minor ehancements that in total should increase performance by around 10%.  
	* Added warning and throws exception when the DSE is full. This is the first of many enhancements to come in this area.
	 
	
Version 0.8.14 4/4/2010
	This release was focused on bug fixes and enhancements related to performance testing. Take a look at 
	http://opendedup.org/index.php/perfmon for more details on performance metrics.

	Fixes:
	
	* File permissions when folders are created is now set properly
	* Fixed issue where SDFS kept file maps open even when files were closed
	* Last Modified for files are now being set correctly, when the file is written too.
	* Deleting of directories works correctly. When rmdir is called it will remove all children
	* When files are deleted that are removed from the file map table. This was not the case in previous versions.
	
	Enhancements
	
	* Performance tuning for reading with larger chunk sizes (64k,128k). The previous default for volume creation 
	required the read-ahead was set to "8". This is not efficient for large block sizes and has been fixed to and
	set to "1" if the block size is greater that 32k.
