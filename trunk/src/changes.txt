Version 0.8.14 4/4/2010
	This release was focused on bug fixes and enhancements related to performance testing. Take a look at 
	http://opendedup.org/index.php/perfmon for more details on performance metrics.

	Fixes:
	
	* File permissions when folders are created is now set properly
	* Fixed issue where SDFS kept file maps open even when files were closed
	* Last Modified for files are now being set correctly, when the file is written too.
	* Deleting of directories works correctly. When rmdir is called it will remove all children
	* When files are deleted that are removed from the file map table. This was not the case in previous versions.
	
	Enhancements
	
	* Performance tuning for reading with larger chunk sizes (64k,128k). The previous default for volume creation 
	required the read-ahead was set to "8". This is not efficient for large block sizes and has been fixed to and
	set to "1" if the block size is greater that 32k.
